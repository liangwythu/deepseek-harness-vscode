## [0.0.3] — 2026-08-16

Tagline: **Diff Review, Approval Workflow & File Context Inlining.**

Closes the biggest experience gap with Cursor/Cline: code changes can now be
reviewed and approved entirely inside VS Code, without switching to the Web UI.

### New features

- **Diff Review & Inline Code Application.** When the agent writes or edits
  files, a review card appears in the sidebar showing each changed file with
  `+added`/`-removed` line counts. Click **Diff** to open VS Code's native
  diff editor (via `dsh-review://` virtual documents). Accept (keep changes)
  or Reject (safe revert via `git checkout`) per-file or all at once. Review
  transactions are tracked by `callId` and linked to the originating tool call.
- **Approval Workflow Integration.** `approval/requested` events now render
  inline as cards with **Allow once** / **Deny** buttons — no more switching to
  the browser. A security allowlist restricts which tools can be approved from
  VS Code; high-risk operations still require the Web UI. Responses are sent
  via `POST /api/respond`.
- **@file Content Inlining.** File references (`@file:path` or
  `@file:path:L10-L20`) now have their content read and inlined directly into
  the user message text (wrapped in `<file path="…">` tags), guaranteeing the
  agent can see file content even when the backend doesn't process the
  `context` field. The `context` metadata (active file, selection) is only
  attached on the **first prompt** of a session to avoid redundant sends.
- **Context Menu Integration.** Right-click a file in the explorer →
  **Add to Harness Chat** inserts an `@file:` reference. Select text in the
  editor → right-click → **Send Selection to Harness** inserts
  `@file:path:L10-L20`. Both use workspace-relative paths for readability.

### Bug fixes

- **@file regex on Windows.** Added negative lookahead `(?!L\d)` to prevent
  `:L<digits>` line ranges from being consumed as part of the file path
  (critical for Windows paths like `e:\folder\file.ts:L10`).
- **Webview regex escaping.** Template literal double-escaping for `\s`/`\d`
  in the webview's `parseAtFilePreview` — without it, `[^\s:]` became
  `[^s:]` which does not exclude whitespace.
- **Skip non-file documents.** `collectEditorContext` now skips documents
  whose URI scheme is not `file` (Output panel, Settings, etc.).
- **Input clearing on @file-only input.** When the input contains only
  `@file:` references, the chat now shows a readable summary like
  `(See: file.ts:L10-L20)` instead of being cleared.

### New modules

- `src/review/` — `ReviewController`, `ReviewStore`, `ReviewVirtualDocumentProvider`,
  `ReviewMaterializer` (6 files, ~500 lines)
- `src/approval/` — `ApprovalStore`, types (2 files, ~150 lines)

## [0.0.2] — 2026-08-15

Tagline: **Conversation UX & Architecture Baseline.**

The "main-branch last direct-push release": hardens structure, rendering
correctness, and interaction UX so that v0.0.3+ can be developed entirely via
feature PRs onto stable boundaries.

### Architecture (structural boundary hardening)

- **`src/app/controller.ts` + `state.ts`** — new `AppController` owns all
  orchestration (connect/disconnect, workspace lifecycle, session lifecycle,
  prompt/cancel, mux dispatch, UiState push). `extension.ts` stays as pure
  wiring: `activate() / deactivate()`, `readConfig()`, command registration,
  and dependency instantiation only.
- **`src/conversation/`** — `ConversationModel` replaces the flat `SessionModel`.
  Events no longer map 1:1 to renderable items; instead they project into
  conversation-semantic `ConversationItem[]` (`user`, `assistant`, `system`,
  `tool`, `status`).
- **`src/workspace/binding.ts`** — workspace creation is split into
  `findHarnessWorkspace()` (discovery, connect-time) and `ensureHarnessWorkspace()`
  (create-on-demand, send-time). The old `resolveHarnessWorkspace()` that
  eagerly prompted for creation inside the connect flow has been removed.
- **`src/view/` split** — `provider.ts` (composition only) is now joined by
  sibling modules: `styles.ts`, `html.ts`, `client.ts` (webview-side JS), and
  `toolPresentation.ts`. React/Preact/Vite are deliberately NOT introduced;
  vanilla DOM continues to carry a couple more releases.

### UX fixes

- **Lazy workspace + session on first Send.** When the user opens a repo
  without a matching Harness workspace, the sidebar stays usable and shows a
  *"Not registered yet — will be created lazily on first send"* banner. The
  first `Send` implicitly creates workspace → creates session → sends the
  prompt, with no confirmation modals. The input textarea is only cleared
  after the optimistic echo reaches the snapshot; prompt text is not lost on
  creation failure.
- **Tool cards are now one item.** `tool/call` + matching `tool/result` are
  merged into a single `ToolItem` owned by `callId`. The sidebar renders a
  collapsed header `🔧 read src/session.ts → ✓ done` that you click to expand
  Arguments + Result. This eliminates the "pink tool-result block" noise.
  `toolPresentation.ts` provides a name-aware pretty title (read, grep, bash,
  write, edit, git_*, …).
- **System messages are their own item kind.** `SystemItem` no longer reuses
  `UserItem` with a `system: true` flag. All downstream filtering is based on
  `item.kind === 'system'` — no more `if user && system` spreads. Default UI
  is a single collapsed line `▸ Runtime context · @deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt`.
- **Assistant Markdown rendering.** `markdown-it` (with `html: false`,
  `linkify: true`) runs **inside the webview**, not the extension host, so
  `ConversationModel` stays semantic-only. User/System messages still render
  with `textContent`. Links open with `target=_blank rel=noopener` and
  `javascript:`/`data:` URLs are stripped. Tool results stay `<pre>` for now.
- **Streaming text now always re-renders.** Each model mutation bumps a
  monotonically increasing `renderVersion`. The webview rebuilds the message
  list **solely** on `snapshot.renderVersion` change — previously, an
  assistant streaming update would often fall through stale `lastSeq` /
  `items.length` signature checks and skip the re-render entirely.

### Test coverage

- Integration test upgraded to exercise `ConversationModel`. New assertions:
  - `renderVersion` strictly increases after a prompt run (1 → 19 in the
    standard "pong" flow).
  - No `tool-call` / `tool-result` kinds leak into `ConversationItem` (they
    are merged; this is enforced both at the type level and at runtime).
  - `systemMessageCount` is tracked separately from user items.

### Discipline

- Explicit **NOT in v0.0.2**: Diff review, approval/respond, inline
  completion, context injection, filesystem provider, terminal integration,
  LSP/ACP/SDK abstractions, transport interfaces. All of these start life as
  feature branches / PRs from v0.0.3 onward.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-15

The first public release. This version proves **one** thing: VS Code and the
browser share the same DeepSeek Harness session.

```
Browser ─────┐
             │
             ▼
       DeepSeek Harness
             ▲
             │
VS Code ─────┘

Same Workspace. Same Session. Same Agent Runtime.
```

### Added

- **Connect** to a local `dsh web` instance via `HTTP /api/*` + `WebSocket /api/events.mux`.
  Loopback-only trust fence (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1`); any other host
  is refused with a clear message.
- **Workspace mapping** — match the active VS Code folder to an existing Harness
  workspace by canonical path; offer to create one if absent (no second workspace ID).
- **Session list** filtered by the resolved workspace, with `+ New Session`.
- **Session history** loaded from the Harness (the single source of truth — no
  local session DB, no `.vscode/deepseek-sessions.json`).
- **Plain-text prompt** sent to the active session.
- **Live streaming** of `assistant/chunk` deltas and tool activity, coalesced by
  an `EventBuffer` that flushes at most every ~30 ms (no per-token re-render).
- **Stop / cancel** the active turn.
- **Reconnect** — on WebSocket close→open, the stream reopens and history is
  refetched (the documented Harness resume semantic is *rebuild*, not cursor-resume).
- **Open Web UI** command (opens `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`; session deep-links are
  intentionally not guessed).
- **Show Logs** command → the `DeepSeek Harness` output channel.
- **Sidebar webview** (vanilla JS, no React) with connection status, workspace,
  session dropdown, message list, input + Send/Stop.
- **Right-side docking** — a "Move to Right Side Bar" command (⇲ button in the
  webview header) relocates the view to the secondary side bar so it no longer
  competes with the file explorer.
- **System-message hiding** — plugin-injected `user/message` frames (e.g.
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt` runtime context, `user-approval` notices)
  are detected via `source.kind !== 'user'` and hidden by default. A `SYS`
  toggle in the header reveals them; the `deepseekHarness.showSystemMessages`
  setting controls the default.
- **Brand icon** — a generated 128×128 PNG (`media/icon.png`) serves as the
  Marketplace icon and the webview header logo; the SVG activity-bar icon uses
  `currentColor` to adapt to the theme. Regenerate with `npm run gen-icon`.
- **Protocol fixtures** (`test/fixtures/`) — sanitized captures of the live wire
  format for detecting upstream protocol drift.
- **Protocol spike** (`scripts/protocol-spike.ts`) and **integration test**
  (`scripts/integration-test.ts`) — standalone Node validation of the full loop
  against a running `dsh web`.

### Security

- Method allowlist: only `host.describe`, `workspace.{list,create}`,
  `session.{list,history,create,prompt,cancel}`.
- Never calls `/api/respond`, `settings.*`, `credentials.*`, `commands.*`, or any
  approval / permission mutation.
- `approval/requested` and `question/requested` frames surface **only** an
  information message ("Action requires approval in DeepSeek Harness Web UI") and
  never respond on the user's behalf.

### Verified against

- DeepSeek Harness host `v0.0.1` (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-root`), default `dsh web`
  port `3080`.
- Wire contract source: `packages/host/apiproxy/src/api/` (authoritative).
- Integration test: 11/11 checks pass against a live local `dsh web`.

### Limitations

- Loopback only — no remote / LAN / WSL-bridged hosts.
- Text prompts only (no image attachments).
- History loads the last ~50 messages; "load older" is deferred.
- Session deep-links in "Open Web UI" are intentionally not guessed.
- Unknown harness event types are ignored (the protocol is merge-extensible);
  they do not crash the client but also do not render.
